# PanelDataFrame

**PanelDataFrame** is an introductory project aimed at teaching/learning data analysis using Python's powerful libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. Through a series of Jupyter notebooks and accompanying datasets,learn how to manipulate, clean, and visualize data effectively.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.6 or higher
* Jupyter Notebook
* Required Python libraries:

  * `pandas`
  * `matplotlib`
  * `seaborn`
  * `sqlite3` (for database interactions)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/toygarpar/PanelDataFrame.git
   cd PanelDataFrame
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Navigate to the cloned repository folder and open the desired notebook to begin.
